My project is on a website for a band called SEVENTEEN. The goal of this website is to ultimately allow their fans to be more informed about this group's history, member interests and discography so that their fanbase would be able to connect with them on a deeper level. This website also allows new fans to quickly learn about the group, as all the group's information such as background, members, media and contact information is compiled all in one place. With such convenience, the group can grow their fanbase at a quicker pace, increasing their success.
This website has many features catering to the differing needs of the fans. It has a homepage, about page, members page as well a as media page. 

Design Process:
As a stan of SEVENTEEN, I personally think It would be best if there was a website or platform where all of their content is compiled into one so that I can source for information better. After immense research, I have decided that as the audience, I would like to know key aspects of this band, and have planned to separate them into key compartments to make the user experience smoother. 

Features:
First of all, the homepage consists of SEVENTEEN's slogan, group pictures, upcoming events for fans to look forward to as well as contact list including the social media pages. 
On the Second page, the abouts page, it showcases the group's background, fandom information, as well as discography. 
On the members page, It lists out all the members and their names. When you click on the a specific member, it shows all their information, group position, facts and interests!
Lastly on the media page, which is where all their media and shows are put together.
In all of the pages, there will be photos and video clips from the band's catalogue.
