My project is on a website for a band called SEVENTEEN. The goal of this website is to ultimately allow their fans to be more informed about this group's history, member interests and discography so that their fanbase would be able to connect with them on a deeper level. This website also allows new fans to quickly learn about the group, as all the group's information such as background, members and media compiled all in one place. With such convenience, the group can grow their fanbase at a quicker pace, increasing their success. This website has many features catering to the differing needs of the fans. It has a homepage, about page, members page as well as a media page. Hence, it addresses the needs of the intended audience. 

Design Process: 
As a stan of SEVENTEEN, I personally think It would be best if there was a website or platform where all of their content is compiled into one so that I can source for information better. After immense research, I have decided that as the audience, I would like to know key aspects of this band, and have planned to separate them into key compartments to make the user experience smoother.

Features: 
First of all, the homepage consists of SEVENTEEN's slogan, group pictures, upcoming events for fans to look forward to as well as contact list including the social media pages at the footer. On the Second page, the abouts page, it showcases the group's background, fandom information, as well as discography. It clearly states all the information but in an easy and colourful manner to make it more fun.  On the members page, It lists out all the members and their names. When you click on the a specific member, it shows all their information, group position, facts and interests! Furthermore, the member page has a dedicated Spotify playlist for them, and a list of posts from their Instagram pages embedded.  Lastly on the media page, which is where all their media and shows are put together. In all of the pages, there will be photos and video clips from the band's catalogue. After completion of the website, I have implemented a few more new features to enhance user experience through increased interaction and responsiveness. There is a scrolling bar at the top of the pages, where it shows the percentage of where the user is in that specific page. When the user is halfway through, the bar will also be scrolled halfway. Moreover, for them to know more about seventeen's colours, I have created a button where they can click on it, and it will change from blue to pink and vice versa. To make it a more immersive experience, I have ensure that the buttons will increase in size once hovered, which brings the users' attention that particular button.
More features that could be implemented: I think it would be great if I could implement a Q&A feature/ section where fans can share their their doubts to their idols, and their idols are able to reply to them as a comment. I think that it would be great to showcase this feature as it could strengthen bonds between fans as well as have a greater sense of connection between fan and idols.
